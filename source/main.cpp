/* TODO LIST:
 * // BUGS //
 * [X] fix weird flipped texture selection
 * [X] fix pointer vector issue when deleting selection
 * [X?] fix eggfault when minimizing using taskbar button
 * [X] When a tile is deselected by clicking an empty space, it for some reason makes every other tile visually selected
 * [X] placement cursor doesn't use TextureMode
 * [X] switching from placement cursor to select and back to place = crash
 * [ ] 2. crash when a tile is selected and textures are reloaded then a tile is placed
 * [ ] can't save directories that contain specific characters to config
 * [ ] weirdly just moving around placing things caused a crash
 * [ ] push to back is VERY broken, either add Z position or fix it - it's messing with textures and crap
 * [ ] place cursor (and probably the actual place position too) is too far behind mouse cursor
 * // UI // 
 * [X] add io.WantCaptureMouse and io.WantCaptureKeyboard checks to ignore input when file dialogues are open
 * [X] load content folder textures as imagebuttons on a grid
 * [X] style ui
 * [X] information gui that shows stuff like the amount of tiles etc
 * [X] toggles for popup menus
 * [X] editor (tool selector, etc) panel
 * [X] section (or separate window) at the bottom of properties panel that lets you set the settings on newly placed tiles
 * [X] grid mode toggle (if tiles have already been placed, they will be snapped to the grid)
 * [?] make fitting window paddings per window
 * [ ] grid settings under editor tab? - opacity, toggle ALSO make it toggle by pressing G
 * [C] [replaced by tile selector] some kind of dropdown for texture selection in the properties panel
 * [C] status gui that shows what process is currently done (mostly useful for stuff like reloading textures, opening or saving a BLF file, etc)
 * [C] beautify file dialog
 * [C] set default file dialog sort mode to name ascending
 * // EDITOR //
 * [X] box draw tool: shortcut 3, click to select start and end point, will use the texturemode of the next tile, right click to fill the area with 1x1 tiles
 * [X] only listen to editor movement commands when no imgui window is focused
 * [X] basic drawing of tiles on a grid
 * [X] non-snapped drawing?
 * [X] draw with selected texture (if none is selected, maybe copy invisible texture to selected content folder and use that)
 * [X] delete tiles with right click
 * [X] select tools with number keys
 * [X] additional properties on tiles (collisions, staticity, size etc, etc, etc)
 * [X] bool in shaders to change color of tiles when they are selected
 * [X] pressing delete or backspace will delete every selected tile
 * [X] toggle overlapping tiles (there will be a bounds check if it's true) (toggle in bottom bar)
 * [X] selecting tiles will show properties for that tile (for multiple selection you can mostly only set them all to the same one)
 * [X] in-editor modifiable ignore list for filenames and / or directories
 * [X] selection tools like area [X], by type [X], etc
 * [X] support for storing tags in tiles (could be one string which is limiting or somehow a map of tags and their names)
 * [X] place cursor should support (and show) grid snap
 * [X] figure out how to draw gizmos (new shaders for them?)
 * [2] variable grid size
 * [ ] improve grid mode and overlap mode:
 * 		- only really 2 of each are required: overlap always or never, grid snap normal or automatic
 * 		- this means they could just be made toggles instead of enums: Auto-snap, Overlap
 * [ ] move tool (with mouse)
 * [ ] resize tool ‍GRRRRR
 * [C] undo, redo, if at all doable
 * // OTHER //
 * [X] fix up editor tile class
 * [X] only recreate transforms array when a tile is modified (use some kind of event system)
 * [X] really just fix the fucking texture loading system
 * [X] proper input for repeating mouse button presses
 * [X] save user data / preferences:
 * --- could be divided up into parts like Gui prefs, editor prefs, etc that are then combined into one file DEBUG A LOT!
 * --- // Gui //
 * --- [X] save file dialog sorting modes, maybe a base directory as well
 * [X] add some way to convert from texture to atlas coordinates and reverse
 * [ ] i realised i could just make the placement gizmo permanent and just change the opacity to 0 to hide it... sure, this would add some constant overhead, but remove unnecessary ifs and memory usage (for creation / destruction)
 * [ ] properly support textures larger than 16x16 in the texture atlas
 * [ ] properly support textures larger than 16x16 in rendering (i would have to get 2 sets of atlasCoords)
 * [?] more options when loading textures (format or smth)
 * [C] create an event system ✌
 * [C] some kind of timer system in render?
 *
